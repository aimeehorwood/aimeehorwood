### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Aimee 


ðŸ‘‰ Iâ€™m an ambitious and proactive junior software engineer and soon-to-be graduate of Makers Academy.

ðŸ‘‰ I'm the sort of person who looks up the ending of films before they're finished. I'm unapologetically curious and like asking the big questions - I don't just need to know why and how it works, but also how it can be better?

ðŸ‘‰ I used to work as a political and communications strategist, now I am using my problem-solving, team-work, communication, and strategic thinking skills to build full stack applications in JavaScript and Ruby. How awesome is that?

ðŸ‘‰ I am ready to utilise OOP, TDD, paired programming, and agile methodologies to a role where I can feed my curiosity and write high quality code to build programs that truly matter
